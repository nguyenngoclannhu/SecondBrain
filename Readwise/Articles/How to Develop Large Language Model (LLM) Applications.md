- Category: #articles
- Summary: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have sparked interest in developing applications that use LLM APIs for both human-to-machine and machine-to-machine interactions. Building these applications comes with challenges, such as managing output consistency and token limits. As LLM technology evolves, integrating these models into software will become easier and more effective, enhancing user experiences.

## Highlights
- djustable temperature parameter that controls the randomness of the output. When you lower the temperature, the output is more deterministic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkf7zr5mydr2jvfbb7p5md9f))
    - Note: useful when applications have a definitive source of truth
- based on the desired trade-off between coherence and creativity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkf80rdy166fzhkyqyhy0tnk))
- Asking the model to cite the answers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkf82cqc9fpzpbpa54wzne9r))
