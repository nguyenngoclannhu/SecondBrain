- Category: #articles
- Summary: Generative AI is revolutionizing text data extraction by quickly processing unstructured data and identifying relevant information. It improves accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional methods like manual entry and OCR. Innovations such as AI-recommended templates and the Generative Information Extractor (GenIE) enable businesses to automate data extraction from complex documents.
