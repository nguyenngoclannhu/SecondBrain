- Summary: LangGraph is a tool for creating AI workflows that use the concept of "state" to track and manage information. Basic and complex state structures allow systems to remember details, such as conversation history or counts, while ensuring data remains immutable. Understanding state in LangGraph enables the development of more sophisticated and context-aware AI applications.

- The `Annotated` type provides additional metadata that LangGraph uses for special handling of message lists (Tuples). This structure is particularly useful for:
  â€¢ Chatbots that need to remember conversation history
  â€¢ AI assistants that maintain context over multiple interactions
  â€¢ Systems that need to track both quantitative (count) and qualitative (messages) data ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jka6z02mqv22ws80gckqzdjz))
