- Full Title: Agents is the most important BTP release this 2024
- Category: #articles
- Summary: Agents are a new approach in AI that use language models to reason and choose actions, enhancing tasks like automation and chatbots. They have components like memory and planning to improve their effectiveness and adaptability. This technology is evolving rapidly, promising greater autonomy and better performance in various applications.

## Highlights
- "**ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models**" by Princeton and Google Brain introduced a framework with the idea to amalgamate reasoning with action in language models to enhance their functionality, versatility, and interoperability, they called it ReACT, and **Agents** were born ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jksgehf8pdz1k7c1j6hj5djd))

    - Note: Agent's made up part
- divides the architecture into four key modules: Profile, Memory, Planning, and Action ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkqmrby0j0eefx4bgq47zr4c))
- **Profile** module serves as the foundation of the Agent's identity and capabilities ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkqmrjf7eb43zcnqmh8y81zt))
- defines the Agent's knowledge base, preferences, skills, and any predefined information that shapes its interactions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkqmrtcqtrrwxdg1ye47bj1v))
- **Memory** **Modules** is the Agent's ability to learn from and reference past interactions, experiences, or information it has processed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkqms4gs9j362p3xbm33fzk3))
- achieve the task's objectiv ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jksp1ka94bgn1585qv04eddq))
- **Planning Module (Reasoning)** is where the Agent synthesizes information from the Profile and Memory modules to make decisions and formulate strategies for achieving its goals ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkqmsjznaq9912n9n18xnmb2))
- **Action Module** is where the Agent executes the decisions made during the Planning phase. This involves interacting with the external environment, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkqmt4gwqw0krcy07233rddr))
- apply our knowledge and expertise within an Agent's ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkqmtqgfg0qj5ydt0hgdmpva))
- two primary types of planning: feedback-independent plans and feedback-based plans ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkqmvv6w8r0mb3qqhpy9bnzw))
- **Single-Path Reasoning** method involves creating plans in a linear, step-by-step sequence ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkqmwmd9q5pp5y3edy7fvh6q))

- ealing with extensive outputs from APIs or databases poses difficulties in maintaining context, and simplifying or dynamically summarizing these outputs ensures that only the most relevant information is retained for the Agent's use. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkqncjhejjc1mvw4jr1r93x9))
