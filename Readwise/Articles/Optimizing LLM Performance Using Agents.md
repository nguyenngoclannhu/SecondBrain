- Full Title: Optimizing LLM Performance Using Agents
- Category: #articles
- Summary: This lesson teaches how to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance using agents, functions, and tools. Agents help translate user input into prompts for the LLM, while functions add special capabilities like accessing data. By combining these elements, users can improve their LLM workflows and achieve better results.

    - Note: Agent Builder?
- Agents are software programs that act like intermediaries between humans and LLMs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkqkngt4wbwdydswbcamr3wt))
- Functions are small units of code that perform specific tasks. LLMs can be augmented with functions that provide them with additional capabilities, such as access to external data sources or the ability to perform complex calculations.

- There are various tools available for LLMs, ranging from simple text editors to complex programming frameworks. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkqksfw9rkst7x312n07xjc8))
- an agent to create a prompt for the LLM that specifies the desired content and format for the report. The agent can then use a function to access a company's data warehouse and retrieve relevant data for the report. Finally, the LLM can generate the report based on the data and the user's prompt.
