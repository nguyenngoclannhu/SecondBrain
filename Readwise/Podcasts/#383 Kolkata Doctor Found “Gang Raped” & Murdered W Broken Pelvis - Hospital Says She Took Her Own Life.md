## Highlights
- **Multiple Assailants**
  - Netizens suspect multiple people were involved in Dr. D's assault and murder, disagreeing with the police's implication of a single perpetrator.
  - A doctor, Dr. Ghaswami, supports this theory, citing the large quantity of semen (150 grams) found in the victim's body as evidence.
  - Online discussions and expert opinions suggest that one person can only produce about 5 to 6 grams of seminal fluid in a given timeframe, even with multiple ejaculations.
  - Based on these estimates, netizens have calculated that as many as 8 individuals could have been involved in the assault.

  Many netizens believe that there must have been at least eight people that were involved in Dr. D's assault and murder. It's been reported that 150 grams of liquid biological fluids, semen, was extracted from Dr. D's body. Which, yes, I do think it is an odd measurement, I imagine, for fluids because that means it would have been weighed. Measuring by fluid ounces seems a tad bit more logical, but continuing on this this train of information that's circulating on the internet. One doctor, Dr. Ghaswami, stated, that quantity cannot be of one person. It suggests that involvement of multiple people. Another states, the post-mortem report revealed several injuries consistent with gang R wording. Some netizens argued that one singular person can only produce about 15 grams of fluids and that's being quite generous. I tried to look into it, the conversions are confusing and obviously it's quite theoretical. I don't think that there's a firm study or number, it's quite subjective. But it would seem 2 to 5 grams of fluid would be produced per each ejaculation. Now netizens have done some similar number crunching and they state that one person can produce approximately 5 to 6 grams in that timeframe, even if they expel the fluids 2 to 3 times, Because it's not going to be the same amount each time. Typically the amount decreases as the frequency goes up. Meaning if it were true that 150 grams of biological fluids were found in her system, in her uterus, ([Time 0:23:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e23d0eb0-efdb-4507-b61f-c34cbb45b4e5))
- **Strange "Self-Exits" at Kolkata Medical College**
  - Multiple "self-exits" have occurred under unusual circumstances at Kolkata Medical College and Hospital, since 2003.
  - One medical student was found dead with a handkerchief in his throat and suspended from a ceiling fan with a string too short to reach, shortly after threatening to expose a deepfake ring at the hospital.
  - Another staff member sedated and cut himself before jumping off a roof.
  - A professor was found dead with bruises and bloodstains.
  - Several junior doctors and interns have leaped from buildings or overdosed.

  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  Speaker 1
  So it just didn't make any sense. But it was forgotten about that in 2003 just two years later another staff member from the medical college self exits by jumping off The roof of the hostel, but before he falls to his death, He allegedly pushes sedatives into his own veins so he sedates himself then grabs medical scissors and Physically goes in and cuts his veins entirely and then he jumps People are like That just doesn't make any sense Right. He left no note behind it appears that his close friends and family They don't think that he would have self exited which again I think it's very hard to say who has the that's why it's so Dangerous because you never really know what someone is thinking in their mind. But these are medical students who think the sequence of events of his self exit just are very unnatural and very bizarre. They sound very strange. It's suspected that he too could have found out about some sort of explicit ring that was operating in the hospital. In 2016, a professor was found dead inside of his home. By the time that the authorities came, his body was badly decomposed. There were bruises on his face and blood stains on the floor of his room. It seems like his death was deemed due to massive heart failure.
  Speaker 2
  Massive heart failure. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  People thought it was weird. The bruises on his face, the blood on the walls, and then just heart failure. It's odd. Then in 2020, there was another self-exit of a junior doctor who leaped from the building. Then another one in 2020 from a trainee doctor. And then in 2023, just last year, a medical intern overdosed on antidepressants. ([Time 0:41:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/00a6e6b0-3f0a-48aa-b9f1-0bd601bc6b14))
- **Similar Cases of Violence Against Women in India**
  - The podcast host mentions the 2012 Delhi bus rape case and other similar incidents to highlight the ongoing issue of violence against women in India.
  - She recounts the case of Aruna Shanbaug, a nurse who was assaulted and left in a vegetative state, and whose attacker received a light sentence.
  - She also mentions Vandana Das, a medical intern killed by a patient. 
  - These cases underscore the vulnerability of women, particularly in the medical profession, and the lack of adequate protection and justice.

  And here we are. It has happened again. To be more specific, Aruna Shambagh was a nurse at a big Mumbai hospital. She was in the hospital basement changing clothes when a hospital custodian snuck in, attacked her, choked her with a dog leash and essayed her. He strangled her so brutally that oxygen was cut off from her brain resulting in a brainstem contusion. Her cervical cord was injured as well as she had complete loss of vision. She was left in an unresponsive state. She died from severe brain damage and paralysis. Her attacker only received seven years in prison. When he was released, he went on to live a very full life, got married, and still had a job as a custodian at a new company. He also mentioned that he did not like her because she was his superior. A woman was his superior. I think that's the part he didn't like. Then there's Vendana Das, a 23 year old medical intern who was stabbed with surgical scissors by a drunken patient. She was killed. So it feels like the doctors are told to save everybody but not a single person tries to save or protect them. And right now the demands are obviously justice. Swift, painful justice to all perpetrators. But also they want an official written apology from the hospital, which I'm hoping could serve for a lawsuit by the victim's family, a judicial investigation and compensation for The victim's family. Many netizens have commented, the CBI taking over the case should not lead to it being quietly buried. The urgent need of the hour is swift justice and the harshest punishment for the culprits. No one who committed this barbaric act should be spared." One comment reads, the best way to survive in society is to be a criminal or someone with power. Being a commoner is very dangerous. They make it seem like it was her fault, that it's her parents' fault, who have lost their only child to such brutality. Why? Because they're not rich? Because they have no political connections? Because Dr. D was an honest hard-working woman? I'm beyond saddened. This could have been anyone. It could be anyone. This is the sad state of our country that we call home. You may think that rape is a sexual act, but no, it's a power act to show a woman her place. Until women are safe, half of India is not safe. At this point it's not just a doctor issue anymore, it's just inhumane. We keep unlocking lower levels of inhumanity ([Time 1:24:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bb455563-2151-4efd-8f43-90777bab08f8))
