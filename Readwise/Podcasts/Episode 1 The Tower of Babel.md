## Highlights
- **God's Fear of the Tower of Babel**
  - The Old Testament God seems apprehensive of the Tower of Babel.
  - Given his omnipotence, he shouldn't feel threatened by Noah's descendants building a city.
  - It's odd that God would attack people building a home during a harmonious period in history, especially after the flood.

  I've always thought this is particularly odd. Why does the old testament god seem apprehensive? In chapter 11 of genesis, you'd think that, being omnipotent and all, he wouldn't be in the least bit threatened by the descendants of noah joining forces and building a city together. Why in the midst of a productive and linguistically unified period ([Time 0:04:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9bdc773c-bf48-4e6a-9c1d-8bc08e001173))
- **Old Testament vs. Other Ancient Texts**
  - The Old Testament was written over about 1,000 years, with the oldest parts dating back to around 700 BCE.
  - This makes the oldest parts roughly contemporary with the Iliad and Odyssey.
  - However, other civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as Ugarit and the Hittites, were producing literary and theological texts even earlier, around the mid-1300s BCE.

  But it doesn't the old testament, if we put it on a shelf alongside narrative and theological texts that predated it, doesn't seem quite so old. First of all, the old testament was composed over the course of almost a thousand years. What many scholars consider its most ancient portion, the song of deborah in the fifth chapter of the book of judges, dates back to the late 700 b c e. Its youngest books were composed far later. Daniel during the late one sixties, in the macabean revolt. Judith, even later, probably during the hasmanian dynasty. Second esdrus, later still, after the roman sack of jerusalem in 70 c e. Fourth macabes, probably even later still. Now that was a dense mass book names and dates, i realize, so let's back up for a second. If biblical scholars are accurate in assuming that the oldest portion of the old testament, a poem in the book of judges, was composed in the seven hundreds b c e, then the very oldest Fragment of the old testament is roughly contemporary with the ancient greek iliad and odyssey, as an canaanite scribes began to compose short hebrew poetry about their martial conquests. Archaic greece already had two full scale epics. But these epics also are youngsters in the time line of human literature, brawny, influential youngsters, but youngsters none the less. Because long before the main portions of the old testament were written and comp all around the eastern mediterranean, a number of civilizations were producing stories in theological Texts. To the immediate northwest of the israelites, in modern day syria, a civilization called ugerit had a literary and theological tradition with a number of distinct parallels to the Old testament. And this tradition was recorded on stone tablets in the mid 13 hundred b c. ([Time 0:10:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e349fd7f-bdf6-4355-8f4e-13ed51612f83))
- **Cuneiform's Importance**
  - The Tower of Babel story symbolizes a major historical event: the rise and fall of cuneiform writing.
  - Cuneiform is arguably the most important invention in history, enabling humans to transcend time and space.
  - It allows us to 'live' after death through our writings, 'travel' through time by reading past works, and connect with others' minds through shared texts.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I think the tower of babel story is about the rise and fall of what was unquestionably the most important invention in human history. This invention, ever since, has enabled us to live long after we die. It has enabled us to travel through time and to exist in many places at once. It has allowed our species to meld minds and experience the consciousness of one another. This invention was called cuneapor.

- **Ancient Mesopotamia's Ecology**
  - Modern-day Iraq's climate is significantly drier than the ancient Mesopotamia of 5,000 years ago.
  - The area around Basra was largely underwater, and the Tigris and Euphrates rivers provided a much wetter ecosystem.
  - This abundance of water and fertile land, created by seasonal flooding and nutrient-rich silt, encouraged the development of agriculture and civilization.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Gradual climate shifts have subsequently dried up these eco systems. When we see modern aries that show sun scorched dig sites in mesopotamian cities, it's important to remember that millennia of climate change have made the ecology of southeastern Iroc to day far different from the way it was five thousand years ago, when much of the area around modern day bazra was under water. The ecology and natural resources of southeastern iroc in the six thousands, five thous s and four thousands provided settlers there with compelling reasons to centralize and band Together. For civilization to grow and spread, the citizens there need some reliable incentive system to organize and collaborate. For the early mesopotamians, the incentive was fresh, usable water. While mesopotamia in five thousand b c e was wet er than it is to day, it was still a hot, dry climate. On one hand, the euphrates provided an abundance of water. On the other, in many places, the river widened into bogs and marshlands, a buggy measma that shifted with every season. Within these marshes, mesopotamian civilization arose around three things. And the first, again, was fresh flowing water. By three thousand mesopotamians up and down the tigris and euphrates had become proficient at irrigation.

- **Cuneiform Clay Tablets**
  - The Sumerians used clay tablets to write, unlike other civilizations that used organic materials like papyrus.
  - Clay tablets, unlike organic materials, have survived for thousands of years, providing extensive records of Sumerian civilization.
  - These records allow us to understand the daily lives of Sumerians, including their trade, religious practices, and legal matters.
  - Because of the durability of clay, we know more about ancient Sumer than we do about relatively more recent civilizations like the Goths and the Gauls, whose records were less well-preserved.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  If the inhabitants of urac had kept written records on papyrus, parchment, wood or any similar organic material, these records would have disintegrated eons ago, like many egyp ones Of the same period likely did. Instead, the urak used special styluses to impress an ever evolving group of written languages, some pictorial, some alphabetic and everything in between, on to clay tablets. Our umbrella term for the written languages that began in sumer is cune form. It was so wide at the height of mesopotamian civilization that historians call the region that used cuneiform the cune form lands. Archaeologists found 20 thousand cune form tablets at ancient trading posts near aleppo in syria in 19 64. A hundred years earlier, archaeologists discovered an even higher quantity of tablets in the ancient amian city of nineveh, modern day mosul eroc to day, we have thousands and thousands Of these cuneiform documents. Many of them have still never been translated, but many of them have because of clay. We know far more about the ancient civilizations of the fertile crescent than we do of much, much more recent ones, of the goths and the alls of roman times. We know almost nothing other than what others wrote about them. But summer stamped its autobiography in clay five thousand years ago.

- **Earliest Written Texts**
  - The earliest written documents, dating back to 2000 BCE from Sumer, aren't literary works like poems or stories. 
  - Instead, they are primarily practical records: trading logs, sacrificial offerings, and lexical lists (proto-cuneiform). 
  - These proto-cuneiform tablets, found mostly in Uruk, are overwhelmingly economic (85%), with a smaller portion (15%) dedicated to lists of words.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The earliest written documents that we have, and these are from the two thousand b c e, and they're from the land of sumer are not filled with sonnets or love stories or flash fiction. The earliest cuneiform tablets are not novels, nor works of philosophy or history. The earliest texts of human history are trading records, their logs of sacrificial rings and lists of things created in a script scholars call proto cune form.

- **Practical Origins of Writing**
  - The earliest forms of writing, like the Uruk tablets, were primarily practical rather than artistic, used for record-keeping of trade, sacrifices, and inventories.
  - Writing emerged as a necessary technology with the growth of larger communities and increased complexity of goods circulation, helping track transactions accurately.
  - While lacking literary or artistic elements, these early records reveal human rationality and creativity in developing a logical system for record-keeping understandable by many.
  - The evolution from pictographs to logographs demonstrates this creative process.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So the origins of writing, as far as we can tell, were practical rather than artistic. If you needed to prove that you gave a guy ten sheep and not five, and he had rolled his lip stick tube shaped personal clay seal on an agreement, and you'd roll yours. Now you had a way. Writing was a technology that became necessary when larger groups began congregating and the circulation of goods became sufficiently complex to necessitate the creation of records. It's not really a romantic origin story, but thankfully, it's pretty easy to understand what the urak tablets, the first proto cune form writings, lack in variety or literary verve. However, they make up for with another quality. In the urak tablets, you can see writing being born. You can see pictographs become standard. You can see ancient record keepers grafting pictographs together to make compound sounds that capture people's names. And then pictographs becoming less visually specific and turning into logographs, abstract symbols that stand for words. In the oldest clay tablets, there is an essential human rationality and creativity ([Time 0:31:23](https://share.snipd.com/snip/aa356467-08c5-4279-a6ed-6784c3b339e7))
- **Cuneiform Decipherment**
  - Cuneiform wasn't a field of study until the 19th century.
  - It was deciphered in the late 1850s.
  - This revealed a civilization older than Israel and possibly even Ancient Egypt.
  - The decipherment shifted our understanding of civilization's beginnings from Greece and Israel to the ancient city of Uruk.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Cune form wasn't even a field of study until the nineteenth century. It wasn't deciphered until the late 18 fifties, when it was first translated, and when we realized that the little, wedge shaped symbols of cune form tracked the course of a civilization Older than israel. Even perhaps older than ancient egypt. We found that the beginnings of civilization were not the marble statues of greece, nor the wanderings of the ancient israelites, but instead the buried tells of iroc.

- **Judah and Babylon's clash of cultures**
  - From Judah's perspective, Babylon was a terrifying superpower, blasphemous and doomed.
  - Babylon viewed Judah as a small, odd kingdom unaware of civilization's evolution.
  - When Judah resisted Babylonian rule too often, Babylon sacked Jerusalem and relocated its people in 586 BCE.
  - In Babylon, the exiled Judahites continued developing the Old Testament, including the Tower of Babel story.
  - The real Tower of Babel was Etemenanki, a 90-meter ziggurat honoring Marduk, one of the world's tallest structures then.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  From the judaite perspective, babylon was a terrifying super power, blasphemous and doomed to divine damnation. And from the babylonian perspective, judah was an odd little kingdom in the boon docks that knew nothing about the main line of civilization's evolution. When this odd little kingdom bucked the yoke of babylonian power one time too many, it was only natural, as far as the babylonians were concerned, to follow standard operating procedure And sack its little capital of jerusalem and redistribute its population. In five 86 b c e, after numerous fallings out with the great babylonian king, nebuchadnezzar, the second a large population of judaites were deported and forced to live in the city of Babylon. There they continued work on the earliest books of the old testament, augmenting, editing and revising ancestral stories and systemizing the religion that would later be called Judaism. One of the stories that they wrote, either in babylon or after the cap ity, was the story of the tower of babel. And while mediaeval depictions of this tower show devils and angels and a gothic spike spiraling upward into the clouds, the real tower of babel was a 90 meter, six stage zigarod called Etemenanki, built to honor the main babylonian god, marduk. Etemenanki didn't reach the stars, ([Time 0:58:02](https://share.snipd.com/snip/17510bf5-9189-4685-bc69-027b45ec6eab))
- **Tower of Babel Inspiration**
  - The Tower of Babel story likely stemmed from Hebrew scribes' experience in exile in Babylon.
  - They were a linguistic minority, intimidated by Babylon's ancient literary and religious culture.
  - The story reflects their unease with the dominant culture and language (cuneiform).
  - It highlights the cultural clash between the exiled Israelites and the Babylonians and their advanced civilization.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We're getting closer to making sense of the tower of babel story. It was written by a generation of hebrew speaking scribes who found themselves an ethnic and linguistic minority in the land of their exile. They had little love for the older culture of babylon. The exiled israelites were intimidated by its ancient and storied literary and religious culture. They probably had to learn some of its language, and likely some of them were trained in the composition of cuneiform clay tablets. And the exiled israelites lived within sight of its giant tower to the babylonian god mardok. But we still haven't unravelled the mystery of why they wrote a story about babylon's language being confused. The babel story ends with the words, so the lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. Why does the story have this bizarre ending? The answer is, i think that exiled hebrew scribes who wrote the story, ([Time 1:02:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0d3269cf-ac18-435f-b2ca-924a6f474e30))
- **Tower of Babel Misconception**
  - The Israelites wrote the story of the Tower of Babel during or after their exile in Babylon.
  - The story is often interpreted as the physical destruction of the ziggurat Etemenanki.
  - However, Etemenanki didn't fall during the Persian takeover; it continued to stand, and the Babylonian god Marduk remained revered for long afterward.
  - Thus, the story isn't tied to a specific historical event of destruction, but likely has a different meaning.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The israelites wrote the strange story of the tower of babel. It's an even stranger story when you learn that the 90 meter zigarot called a temenanki didn't actually come down when the persians took over babylon. Etemenanke still stood, and the old babylonian god mardok was still revered long into the persian period. ([Time 1:15:13](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0abc7a91-2962-46ba-a3ce-5ab9b9da0322))
- **The Fall of Cuneiform**
  - The Tower of Babel story isn't about a specific historical event like the destruction of a tower or the eradication of Babylonian culture.
  - It symbolizes the decline of cuneiform writing after the Persian takeover of Babylon in 539 BCE.
  - For the first time, Mesopotamia was ruled by a foreign power, the Achaemenid Persians, leading to a linguistic shift.
  - Cuneiform, the shared written language of the region for millennia, became obsolete due to the influx of diverse linguistic groups.
  - This marked a transition to phonetic alphabets in the Mediterranean and Near East.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The tower of story is, i think, about the end of cunea form. Because when the persians took babylon for the first time, mesopotamia was ruled by a foreign power. In the two thousand, 500 years of mesopotamia's history, dynasties had come and gone and regions had come under foreign sway. Power had been subdivided and splintered. But what happened on october twelfth five, 39, when the persians successfully took babylon and with it all of mesopotamia. Had never happened before. Suddenly, a people based in present day iron ruled present day iroc, and then jordan and israel and lebanon, and soon they began spilling down into egypt. The persian takeover was the moment when the critical mass of emigrating linguistic groups finally and irreversibly made the written language of mesopotamia obsolete. The mesopotamian cuneiform tablet, the paramount emblem of a civilization that had been rising for thousands of years, which had once been the medium of communication for the bulwark Of human civilization, was ended.
