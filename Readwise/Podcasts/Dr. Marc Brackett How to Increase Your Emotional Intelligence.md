## Highlights
- Master Your Emotions: The RULER Approach
  The RULER approach outlines essential emotional intelligence skills. The first skill is recognizing emotions, which involves interpreting facial expressions and understanding the origins and consequences of feelings. The second skill focuses on labeling emotions accurately with precise vocabulary. The third skill emphasizes the importance of expressing emotions appropriately, considering the context and cultural differences. Finally, the core skill is regulating emotions, which encompasses managing and adjusting one's emotional responses effectively.

  Speaker 1
  The way I talk about it is as a set of skills and we use the acronym ruler to describe those skills. The first is recognizing emotions. So I'm trying to read your facial expression right now. Right? Are you interested? Are you bored already? I'm trying to understand emotions. Where are they coming from? Like, why am I feeling this way? What's the consequence of that feeling? The third is labeling emotions. So being precise with the words that we use to describe our feelings. The fourth is expressing emotions, knowing how and when to express emotions with different people across context and culture. And then the big one is the final R, which is regulating emotions.

- Understand the Why to Regulate Emotion
  Understanding the underlying reasons for feelings is crucial for effective emotional regulation. Simply labeling emotions is insufficient; individuals must connect their feelings with the specific causes behind them. This deeper understanding allows for more targeted strategies, such as cognitive approaches to manage anxiety, rather than relying solely on superficial techniques like breathing exercises. By learning to articulate and analyze their emotions, people can gain better control over their emotional responses.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  What do they mean to you? Anyhow, finally, we get to like the definitions. And then I say, you know, who cares? Like, why am I asking you to like understand these differences? Go back to your groups and talk about it. And then after like, this is like a 45 minute, like I thought this was going to be like a two minute activity, it turns into like a 45 minute to an hour exercise because they finally realize, Oh yeah, so if I'm anxious because I'm worrying about the future, you know, maybe the breathing exercise is not going to be as helpful because maybe I need a cognitive strategy to say, You know, Mark, stop worrying about the stock market. Mark, stop worrying about the university closed down because of the pandemic. You got no control over the university's decisions. And so helping people make connections between the feeling and the reason for the feeling, from my perspective, has been very helpful to help them learn how to regulate the emotion.
  Speaker 2
  So connecting the feeling and the reason for the feeling. Correct. As opposed to just labeling the feeling. Yeah, you need to know why. It's the why that you really have to deal with. How do you feel about emojis? From everything you're saying, they seem like more than benign to me. ([Time 0:17:37](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fe8b9426-4f85-43b3-9fbb-218aad8afe1d))
- Understand Emotions through the Mood Meter
  The Mood Meter categorizes emotions into four distinct quadrants based on two axes: pleasantness and energy. The yellow quadrant represents high energy and pleasant emotions like happiness and excitement. The green quadrant signifies low energy but still pleasant feelings such as calmness and contentment. The blue quadrant indicates low energy and unpleasant emotions, encompassing feelings like sadness and despair. Finally, the red quadrant is characterized by high energy and highly unpleasant emotions, including anger and anxiety. This framework aids individuals in identifying their emotional states, empowering them to explore options and responses based on their specific feelings.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And then we cross those two axes to create what we call in our work the mood meter. And there are four quadrants. We got high pleasant, high energy, yellow. So think about emotions there. Happy, excited, elated, ecstatic, optimistic. We got the green, so that's low energy and pleasant still. That's the calm, content, tranquil, peaceful, relaxed quadrant. And then we have the unpleasant side. And I'm going to repeat myself. It's not the bad emotions or the negative emotions. We're going to call them unpleasant because it's not generally pleasant to be sad or down or disappointed or hopeless or feeling despair, which is the blue or that low energy unpleasant. And we got our red quadrant on the mood meter, which we'll call the high energy, highly unpleasant emotions, which are feelings of anger and anxiety. So it's very helpful for people because, you know, when you're, like you even said this yourself, like, you're not really sure how you're feeling. And we know our inner lives are complex. So to be able to have a tool that has four quadrants where you go like, I don't know, am I pleasant? I guess I'm kind of pleasant. But am I energies low? All right, I'm in the green. All right, now what are my options there? No, I'm feeling quite energized and pleasant. Oh, what are my options there, etc. ([Time 1:02:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b39cd8f5-70ee-48cf-a28d-dfa6c0edd6aa))
- Understanding Emotions Through Quadrants
  Utilizing a mood meter divided into four quadrants helps individuals identify and understand their emotional states, encompassing a range from high energy and unpleasant emotions like anger and anxiety to low energy and pleasant feelings. By assessing where they fall on this spectrum, people can gain clarity about their emotions, which is beneficial for both young children and professionals alike. This self-awareness allows individuals to better recognize their feelings and the underlying triggers, such as anxiety before a public speaking event or a challenging meeting, leading to more informed emotional responses and decisions.

  And we got our red quadrant on the mood meter, which we'll call the high energy, highly unpleasant emotions, which are feelings of anger and anxiety. So it's very helpful for people because, you know, when you're, like you even said this yourself, like, you're not really sure how you're feeling. And we know our inner lives are complex. So to be able to have a tool that has four quadrants where you go like, I don't know, am I pleasant? I guess I'm kind of pleasant. But am I energies low? All right, I'm in the green. All right, now what are my options there? No, I'm feeling quite energized and pleasant. Oh, what are my options there, etc. We find that in, for both preschoolers and CEOs, very helpful, extremely helpful. And then, you know, going back to ruler for a minute, we might talk about the quadrant as being the R for self-awareness, right? Recognizing like, where am I in emotion space? And then you might ask yourself like, all right, well, what's going on? You know, what's called, why am I thinking that I'm in the yellow or red or blue or green? What just happened? What might be happening? Oh, I'm about to be on a podcast. Oh, I'm about to take a test. Oh, I'm about to go into a difficult meeting with a colleague.

- Embrace Emotional Ephemerality
  The next generation may possess heightened emotional intelligence, demonstrating the potential value of emotional education. A child's understanding that unpleasant feelings do not require fixing reveals a profound insight: emotions are temporary and manageable. This ability to recognize and accept transient emotional states illustrates an emerging resilience in emotional processing, emphasizing the importance of teaching future generations about the nature of emotions.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Wow. Maybe the next generations coming up are far more emotionally intelligent than ours, if I may.
  Speaker 1
  If they are, if they get direct instruction, that's my vision for the world, is that everyone gets an emotion education. And the boy says, no, you know, I know it's going to go away. I'm fine. I'm like, okay, I'm bad at this kid. Like, you're my teacher. You know, it was amazing. And to think that that five-year had that insight, that he had an unpleasant feeling that didn't need to be fixed, that it was okay, that he just knew he was a little funkin', but he has Already experienced that emotions are ephemeral, you know, and he just let it go and he'll be in the green a little later or the red or whatever else. It was really kind of mind blowing. ([Time 1:05:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/50fd4138-adfe-4fd1-aaad-1f2a858920c5))
- Permission to Feel is Essential
  Recognizing emotions and providing a safe space for expression is crucial for well-being. Research indicates that many individuals lack the supportive relationships that would allow them to openly feel and articulate their emotions. Only about one-third of adults report having an influential figure in their youth who encouraged emotional expression. The importance of emotional awareness and the necessity of cultivating an environment where feelings are acknowledged must not be overshadowed by the emphasis on skill building.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And I have good research to show that. You know, you've read my book, you know I had an Uncle Marvin. He was a middle school teacher who, you know, by some wave of a magic wand, was staying with my family one summer when I was 12. And he noticed something in my facial expression, my body language. He knew something was off. And he was the first adult who sat with me and said, hey Mark, how are you feeling? And I don't know if it was his facial expression, his body language, his vocal tone, but that was the opener for me. I'm not doing so well. I don't really like life very much. I'm scared. And he didn't say, I'm going to have a nervous breakdown or toughen up. He said, we're going to get through this. I got you. I'm with you. And it's really interesting to me because, you know, I feel like we're so focused on skill building, which is really important. But I want to take a step back and say, are we giving ourselves? Are we giving our colleagues, our partners, our children the permission to feel? And I feel like a lot of people don't have that permission. Now my research shows with tens of thousands of people across cultures, that only about a third of adults felt that they had someone when they were young who created the conditions for Them to have permission to feel.

- Transform Envy into Growth
  Emotions, especially unpleasant ones like envy, can serve as powerful motivators for personal growth. When envy manifests as short-lived and inspirational, it can be harnessed to learn and improve one's own skills. However, it's crucial to differentiate between envy that drives admiration and inspiration versus envy that breeds resentment. Embracing the former can lead to constructive self-reflection and development, while the latter should be addressed to avoid negative emotional states.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  You know, the way I think about emotions as being, you know, we need to get help with our emotions is when, if it's an unpleasant one, it's intense in long duration. Momentary envy. I get envious all the time. I watched TED talks, I'm like, oh, that timing was amazing. I'm like, I'm going to try that out. So I use that envy of someone else's skill as a way to grow.
  Speaker 2
  How does that differ, sorry, to turn your own work back on you from admiration or inspiration? Like, wow, they, like the- Yeah, that's what I'm getting at.
  Speaker 1
  So that's the difference between, you know, the envy that leans toward admiration versus the envy, like what you're referring to, that leads to resentment. Right? ([Time 1:31:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eea8b12f-7d06-4215-8f18-a66f5f5d523a))
- Balance Empathy with Emotional Intelligence
  Empathy is crucial in healthcare, especially for patients with terminal illnesses like cancer. Doctors often learn to suppress empathy, which can hinder patient relationships at a critical time. Acknowledging the emotional weight of treating patients, practitioners should strive for a balance that includes emotional intelligence—specifically, the ability to regulate their emotions. Rather than succumbing to despair over patient outcomes, doctors can reframe their role as one of providing meaningful support during a patient’s final months, transforming their mindset into one focused on the gift of compassion they offer.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Okay, great, great. That's fantastic. Because that's empathy without emotional intelligence. And so I work with a lot of doctors. I've done quite a bit of work with the cancer hospital at Yale. It's called Smilo. And you know, doctors have been taught from early on, you know, like leave your empathy at the door. And I challenge that. You know, when you're a patient with cancer, knowing that you may pass, the last thing you want is an unempathic doctor. You want a relationship with someone who's treating you. And the assumption is that you get lost in your empathy. And people have written about that. And it's true, there is overzealous empathy, you can have compassion, fatigue. But again, it's in the absence of, you know, emotional intelligence. What do I mean? Well, part of emotional intelligence is regulation. And so if I see my work as a cancer doctor as helping people have the best last few months of their lives, that's a really interesting way to think about it. So as I'm in relationship with my patient, my mindset is, I've come to the understanding that my job, you know, people pass. But I could go down a rabbit hole of despair because everyone potentially may pass. Or I can see this as I'm giving someone a gift.
