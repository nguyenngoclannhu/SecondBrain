## Highlights
- Cultural Self-Destruction is the True Threat
  Civilizations often face internal threats rather than external ones, primarily through cultural self-destruction. A pervasive belief that one's society is fundamentally flawed—rooted in historical injustices like slavery and colonialism—fuels this risk. Questioning the value of one's society undermines the desire to defend it, impart its values to future generations, or ensure its survival. Current global events, such as conflicts in Ukraine and Afghanistan’s political shifts, serve as cautionary examples of the consequences of losing faith in societal structures.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  So what is the threat? Because you love the UK. It's all going great. What is the threat that you see on the horizon? And how do you prove that threat is real?
  Speaker 1
  If you look at history, and I'm no historian, but if you read interesting people about history, most civilizations are not destroyed from the outside. They're destroyed through suicide, through cultural suicide. And I think one of the big threats I've been raising the alarm on for a long time is what people talk about as woke culture progress and, you know, rampant progressivism, whatever you Want to call it. But at the heart of it is the idea that we are bad. Our society is bad. It's based, our history is bad. It's based on, you know, slavery and colonialism and exploitation and imperialism and all of this stuff. And how do you prove that? Well, there's several ways to think about it. The first one is if you thought your society was bad, why would you defend it? Why would you teach its values to your children? Why would you want it to persevere and continue to exist? Been predicting now for a long time. Look at what happened in Ukraine. Look at what happened in Afghanistan with the withdrawal of American forces.

- Focus on Prosperity, Not Identity
  Categorizing individuals solely by group identity oversimplifies complex socio-economic dynamics and perpetuates division. This perspective ignores the need to investigate the factors that foster success and prosperity among diverse groups. Understanding the root causes of success, rather than merely attributing struggles to oppression, is essential for constructive discourse on social outcomes.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  We can't say, you know, different groups do different in society for all sorts of different reasons. If someone is not doing as well as someone else, that's because they've been oppressed, right? And then you work out this hierarchy, white people of the evil at the top, you throw in some other successful minorities. For example, in the UK and in America, Asians from the Far East, Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, they do very well. So they are now seen as part of the kind of more the oppressor groups. That's why in American colleges, for example, they're discriminated against in admissions because they do better than Hispanics and Blacks. So it's essentially a way of creating a very, very simplistic and frankly ridiculous way of looking at people, not as individuals, Stephen Constantine, but as groups, Black, White, Russian, Jewish, whatever way you want to look at it and it's this Generalized thing and one of the reasons it's so destructive is it's asking all the wrong questions It's it's asking The question of why do why are people struggling? Right, but it doesn't ask it from the right perspective The real you know poverty is the norm. The real question is what creates prosperity? What creates success? What creates successful outcomes for different groups? ([Time 0:14:12](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dd46be75-fabd-4a4d-a477-d414f43f3ed9))
- Beware the Perils of Victimhood
  An elevation of victimhood mentality fosters obsession with racial, sexual, and gender dynamics, promoting a dangerous anti-Western and anti-male ideology that undermines societal cohesion. This ideology encourages individuals to view themselves and others as members of divided tribes, leading to harmful effects on personal well-being. A victimhood mindset can manifest as self-harm, as psychological principles like 'perception is projection' indicate that our internal values shape how we perceive the world. This emphasizes the need for individuals to re-examine their mindset to avoid the detrimental consequences of victimhood.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So it's the elevation of victimhood. It's obsession about racial and sexual and gender dynamics. And it's the promotion of a kind of anti-Western, anti-white, anti-male ideology that I believe is very, very dangerous to actually the very great societies that we've created, which Are based on the idea that, you know, I have some issues with multiculturalism, but a multiracial society, I think, is a very healthy thing, provided we are not encouraged to see each Other as members of separate and divided tribes. But that is exactly what this ideology does. What is the harm of victimhood?
  Speaker 2
  And how is that really showing up in people's everyday lives from an individual standpoint? And so I really want to know like, how victimhood is becoming self-harm. So if I choose to adopt a victimhood mindset, how does that hurt me, Stephen?
  Speaker 1
  Well, oh, I mean, there's 100 different ways. But one of the things we know from psychology is what they call perception is projection. I don't know if you're familiar with this idea. Okay, you've had Jordan Peterson on the show, right? So one of the things she talks about is you cannot see unless you have a hierarchy of value in your mind, right? There is an almost unlimited number of things I could be looking at in this room. ([Time 0:15:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1a773475-b4b6-4564-a7ed-2251cd35cbdd))
- Beware the Tyranny of Good Intentions
  Progressive ideas, while well-meaning, can lead to tyranny if they promote authoritarian actions under the guise of helping others. Such actions can lack moral restraint, resulting in harmful consequences. A proposed solution to support underrepresented communities is to establish platforms highlighting successful role models who resonate with those backgrounds. This approach may inspire and provide practical insights, debunking the harmful notion that one cannot aspire to success without representation. Additionally, there's a critical view on replacing proven methods with appealing, yet ineffective, initiatives over the past few decades.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Totally. But this is the thing with a lot of progressive ideas. They are incredibly well-meaning. They're incredible by meaning, which is what makes them so dangerous. Because, um, I always forget this quote, but there's a wonderful quote about this, which is, that a tyranny exercised for your own good is much worse than a tyranny that's exercised Out of pure evil. Because at least the evil person knows they're being evil. But when someone is trying to help you by being tyrannical towards you, I mean, this is a different context, but the point is the same. When someone is doing something to you because they think they're helping, they are not held back by their conscience at all. And so they will do whatever the hell they think is the right thing in order to help you. What might be a good way of helping people who come from backgrounds where there is less entrepreneurial success, and maybe that is the case, I don't know what the statistics are, is Creating a school of black business excellence, right? Like here's 10 guys like you who come in and talk about how you were great, and here's some tips, and here's what you do, and here's what I did. Inspiration, right? Now look, I don't buy personally into this idea that, like, there's this narrative of you can't be what you can't see. I think that's one of the most pernicious and dangerous ideas that we've seen in recent years. But to the extent that there are people who need someone who looks like them, maybe that's the way that you do it. There is a great writer, American writer, called Thomas Sowell. I don't know if you're familiar with his work. I know. Brother, if you read his stuff, you will be hooked. One of the things he talks about is the fact that over the last 30, 40 years, we have replaced things that work with things that sound good.

- Inspiration Over Illusion: Real Strategies for Success
  Creating environments, like a school of black business excellence, can provide relatable success stories and practical tips for aspiring entrepreneurs from underrepresented backgrounds. However, it's crucial to critique the prevalent belief that visibility alone ensures achievability; this notion can be misleading. Effective strategies should prioritize proven methods over appealing but ineffective narratives. Moreover, the rise of movements centered on social justice and wokeness has gained traction with the advent of social media, which often prioritizes ideology over real-world impact.

  What might be a good way of helping people who come from backgrounds where there is less entrepreneurial success, and maybe that is the case, I don't know what the statistics are, is Creating a school of black business excellence, right? Like here's 10 guys like you who come in and talk about how you were great, and here's some tips, and here's what you do, and here's what I did. Inspiration, right? Now look, I don't buy personally into this idea that, like, there's this narrative of you can't be what you can't see.

One of the things he talks about is the fact that over the last 30, 40 years, we have replaced things that work with things that sound good. And so much of what we now do in our society is things that sound good like that program, but don't actually help anyone. They don't actually work very well. And when we talked about why wokeness really takes off in 2014, one of the reasons I believe, and there's a lot of evidence for this, and you can look this up and even maybe flash up some Graphs about this, when social media comes along, that's when this stuff really takes off, because social media is completely detached from the real world.

- Debt Breaks the Intergenerational Contract
  Internal divisions and conflicts are notable factors in the rise and decline of civilizations. However, a critical economic issue facing Western countries is the alarming level of debt, which disrupts the intergenerational contract between current generations and their descendants. This debt signifies a lack of willingness among previous generations to make sacrifices for future ones, indicating that society is presently borrowing from future potential, as evidenced by operating at over 100% of GDP in debt.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  And just to be clear, the reason why it's coming to an end in your view is because of the internal division and the internal conflict.
  Speaker 1
  That's part of it. Look, it's a look, the rise and decline of civilizations is a very complicated thing. Part of it is economic, right? But even if you look at our economic problems, the biggest problem that Western countries face is our level of debt, right? Look at debt as a societal issue, national debt. What does that mean? Well, one of the things it means is we've broken the intergenerational contract between your generation, your children's generation, and the generation before yours and mine. Right? Effectively, our parents are unwilling to sacrifice for their grandchildren. That's what debt means. Because what we're doing is we're borrowing from the future. Right? We are operating in more than 100% of GDP debt at the moment. ([Time 0:39:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/eaba1b61-fbc4-4cce-bc5d-97b328c956e2))
- Communism: A Family Affair, Not a Societal Solution
  Communism functions effectively at the family level, where shared resources and collective efforts fulfill mutual needs. In families, individuals contribute based on their abilities, leading to equitable distribution of necessities. However, this model fails in broader society due to inherent self-interest among individuals. The enforcement of communism on a larger scale often requires coercion, which has historically resulted in mass violence and oppression, as seen in the Soviet Union and China. The ideology asserts that global acceptance of communism is necessary for its success, as external capitalist influences undermine its principles.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Oh very simple You've got to take from the oppressors and you've got to give to the oppressed. From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. However, the problem is, it turns out that communism is effectively a great idea at the family level. Like, your family is a communist society, so is mine. Like, I go out to work, I earn money, we spend it together on the needs of my wife, my children, blah, blah, blah. That's communism, right? We share what one productive person produces. Other people do other jobs, they may not be paid as well, blah, blah, blah. The level of society doesn't really work because people are self-interested. And to make them not self-interested, to make them all give up everything for the needs of the state and of other people, you have to use a lot of force, right? Which is why you have to kill 50 million people in Russia, 50 million people in China to even make it happen. Now, what happened was, you got to remember, this is very important, people forget this. When the Soviet Union was created, it was not designed to be a country-wide phenomenon. The Communists believed that the only, rightly by the way, that the only way communism would work is if you made everyone in the world communist. Because if you made everyone communist, then no one could look at over the border and look at these evil capitalists having a great life.

- Embrace Immigration with Caution
  Recognizing the distinction between legal and illegal immigration is crucial for societal integration and stability. Promoting legal immigration is beneficial when the selected individuals are a cultural fit, driven, and ambitious, contributing positively to the host society. However, an influx of immigrants in a short period can overwhelm the system and lead to tensions. It is vital to manage immigration thoughtfully by ensuring newcomers can integrate, learn the language, and adapt to their new environment, allowing societies to maintain harmony while fulfilling their immigration needs.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I think you and I, I don't know what you actually think, but certainly in terms of your arguments you're putting to me, you're coming from a different place. I think we've got to the place that we understand that I'm not anti-immigrants. And I'm actually pro-immigration in the sense that, well, I'm not pro anti-immigration since it depends on the time that you're in. But generally speaking, I think when you choose the people who come, when they're culturally a good fit for that society, when they're driven and talented and ambitious and blah, blah, Blah, blah, blah, that is going to be hugely beneficial to your country. And I am for having legal immigration at the level that is beneficial to our society, which is not zero. Legal immigration, I think, can be very conducive. So not anti-immigrant, otherwise I'd have to be anti-me. But at the same time, I think illegal immigration, it just shouldn't be happening. Yeah.
  Speaker 2
  We agree. And that's quite rare, actually, the ability to say that immigrants aren't bad people, they're not the bad ones necessarily, they're not the ones to demonize. Although, of course, there's exceptions. And that legal immigration is good, illegal immigration is bad.
  Speaker 1
  Well, again, legal immigration can be good. Right? If it's very large numbers of people in a very short period of time, that becomes very difficult to digest for the host society. And then tensions arise of the kind that you're talking about. So, my view is you want to bring in the right number of people, you want to make sure that they're able to integrate, make themselves at home, learn the language, adapt, and then you can Bring more people if that's what your society needs at that time.
  Speaker 2
  What's the most important thing we didn't talk about that we should have talked about? That's a good question. Trade-off denialism. Interesting. Trade-off denialism. ([Time 1:48:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0aaf0bfb-f65c-4765-907c-9f0267cba07f))
