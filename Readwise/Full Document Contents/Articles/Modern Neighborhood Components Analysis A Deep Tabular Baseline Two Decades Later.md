###### Abstract

The growing success of deep learning in various domains has prompted investigations into its application to tabular data, where deep models have shown promising results compared to traditional tree-based methods. In this paper, we revisit Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA), a classic tabular prediction method introduced in 2004, designed to learn a linear projection that captures semantic similarities between instances. We find that minor modifications, such as adjustments to the learning objectives and the integration of deep learning architectures, significantly enhance NCA’s performance, enabling it to surpass most modern deep tabular models. Additionally, we introduce a stochastic neighbor sampling strategy that improves both the efficiency and predictive accuracy of our proposed ModernNCA— sampling only a subset of neighbors during training, while utilizing the entire neighborhood during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ModernNCA achieves state-of-the-art results in both classification and regression tasks across various tabular datasets, outperforming both tree-based and other deep tabular models, while also reducing training time and model size.

####  1 Introduction

Tabular data, characterized by its highly structured format of rows and columns representing individual examples and specific features, is prevalent in domains such as healthcare [[26](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib26)] and e-commerce [[39](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib39)]. Inspired by the success of deep neural networks in fields like vision and language [[50](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib50), [57](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib57), [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib17)], numerous deep models have been developed to handle tabular data, capturing complex feature interactions and achieving promising results [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib13), [24](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib24), [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib42), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib4), [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib20), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib31), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib10), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib11), [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib27)].

In contrast to parametric approaches like MLPs that make predictions directly, non-parametric methods such as nearest neighbors utilize the entire training dataset and leverage relationships between instances for tabular prediction [[38](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib38)]. Metric learning, rather than relying on raw features, aims to learn a distance metric corresponding to an embedding space where semantically similar instances are close together and dissimilar ones are far apart [[62](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib62), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib14), [35](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib35), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib7)]. These improved distance metrics facilitate the discerning process of non-parametric/neighborhood-based methods and are particularly beneficial when dealing with a large number of classes [[61](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib61)]. classes [[61](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib61)].

Although metric learning approaches perform well compared to vanilla nearest neighbor methods, they often struggle to match the predictive power of tree-based nonlinear approaches like Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib12), [43](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib43)] on tabular data. However, the recent successes of deep metric learning in diverse domains such as image recognition[[47](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib47), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib51), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib52), [34](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib34)], person re-identification [[69](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib69), [64](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib64)], and recommendation systems [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib28), [60](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib60)] suggest its untapped potential for tabular datasets. Moreover, specially designed MLP architectures and weight regularization strategies have enabled simple parametric models like MLPs to excel on many tabular datasets [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib20), [30](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib30)], indicating that similar improvements could also benefit neighborhood-based methods.

Figure 1: Performance-Efficiency-Size comparison between ModernNCA on classification (a) and regression (b) datasets. Representative tabular prediction methods, including the classical methods (in green), the parametric deep methods (in blue), and the non-parametric/neighborhood-based deep methods (in red), are investigated, based on their records over all datasets in [Table 1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S5.T1) and [Table 2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S5.T2). The average rank among these eight methods is used as the performance measure. We calculate the average training time (in seconds) and the size of the model (denoted by the radius of the circles, where the larger the circle, the bigger the model). ModernNCA achieves high training speed compared to other deep tabular models and has a lower model size. TabCon is another proposed baseline. ModernNCA outperforms other methods in two cases. 
This leads us to a pivotal question: “Can we improve metric learning with modern deep learning techniques to achieve competitive performance in tabular prediction tasks?”

In this paper, we revisit the classical metric learning approach, Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA), originally proposed by Goldberger et al. [[19](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib19)] in 2004. NCA optimizes the prediction accuracy of the target instance based on its neighbors in a linearly projected space. With simple modifications to NCA, our enhanced method, ModernNCA, effectively addresses tabular prediction tasks.

In particular, our ModernNCA introduces a learning objective tailored for both classification and regression tasks. We further explore a deep neural network architecture that projects input instances into a latent embedding space in a nonlinear manner. Given that NCA’s prediction relies on the set of neighbors, which increases the batch size and computational burden during training, we employ a Stochastic Neighborhood Sampling (SNS) strategy. SNS randomly selects a subset of the training set as neighbors during training while utilizing the entire training set in the test phase. This strategy improves not only the training efficiency but also the generalization capability of the model. Our experiments validate that ModernNCA outperforms most existing tabular prediction methods, including both tree-based and deep learning approaches, across various datasets. [Figure 1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S1.F1) demonstrates that ModernNCA balances training efficiency (with lower training time compared to other deep tabular models), generalization ability (with higher average accuracy), and model size. The contributions of our paper are:

* • We revisit the classical metric learning approach NCA and explore ways to improve the model’s performance with modern deep learning techniques.
* • Our proposed ModernNCA is capable of both classification and regression tasks. An additional sampling strategy improves the training efficiency and the generalization ability of the model.
* • Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that ModernNCA serves as a strong deep tabular baseline for tabular prediction tasks.

Learning with Tabular Data. Tabular data is a common format across various applications such as click-through rate prediction [[45](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib45)] and time-series forecasting [[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib1)]. Tree-based methods like XGBoost [[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib12)], LightGBM [[32](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib32)], and CatBoost [[43](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib43)] have proven effective at capturing feature interactions and are widely used in real-world applications. Since changes in model families and hyper-parameters can significantly affect a model’s generalization ability [[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib16)], some strategies focus on automated model selection and hyper-parameter tuning to optimize performance across different tasks [[18](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib18), [25](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib25)].

Deep Tabular Data Learning. Recognizing the ability of deep neural networks to learn feature representations from raw data and make nonlinear predictions, recent methods have applied deep learning techniques to tabular models [[13](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib13), [24](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib24), [42](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib42), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib9), [4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib4), [30](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib30), [31](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib31), [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib11)]. For instance, deep architectures such as residual networks and transformers have been adapted for tabular prediction [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib20), [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib27)]. Moreover, data augmentation strategies have been introduced to mitigate overfitting in deep models [[54](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib54), [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib6), [46](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib46)]. Deep tabular models have demonstrated competitive performance across a wide range of applications, and pre-trained deep tabular predictors have shown the ability to generalize to downstream tabular tasks [[36](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib36), [27](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib27), [48](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib48), [41](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib41), [71](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib71), [70](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib70), [67](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib67)]. However, researchers have observed that deep models still face challenges in capturing high-order feature interactions as effectively as tree-based models [[23](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib23), [37](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib37)].

Metric Learning. Methods like K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) make predictions based on the entire training set. The choice of distance metric critically determines the set of neighbors and affects the discriminative ability of the model [[62](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib62), [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib19)]. Metric learning learns a projection to bring similar instances closer together and push dissimilar ones farther apart, which further yields improved classification and regression results of KNN [[14](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib14), [61](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib61), [35](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib35), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib7)]. In addition to linear metrics, nonlinear metrics are often implemented using multiple metrics [[44](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib44), [65](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib65), [66](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib66)], local composition [[59](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib59), [49](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib49), [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib3), [40](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib40)], or kernel methods [[33](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib33), [63](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib63)]. Initially focused on tabular data, metric learning has become a valuable tool when integrated with deep learning techniques across various domains such as image recognition [[47](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib47), [51](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib51), [52](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib52), [34](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib34)], person re-identification [[69](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib69), [64](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib64)], and recommendation systems [[28](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib28), [60](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib60)]. Recently, TabR [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib22)] incorporated metric learning with transformers [[57](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib57)] to enhance tabular predictions through neighborhood-based methods. Despite promising results, the extensive computational burden of neighborhood selection and the complicated architecture limit TabR’s practicality. Based on the classical method NCA [[19](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib19)], we propose a simple deep tabular baseline that maintains efficient training speeds without sacrificing performance.

####  3 Preliminary

In this section, we first introduce the task learning with tabular data. We then provide a brief overview of metric learning approaches for tabular data, specifically on the NCA method.

#####  3.1 Learning with Tabular Data

A labeled tabular dataset is formatted as N𝑁Nitalic\_N examples (rows in the table) and d𝑑ditalic\_d features/attributes (columns in the table). An instance 𝒙isubscript𝒙𝑖{\bm{x}}\_{i}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT is depicted by its d𝑑ditalic\_d feature values. There are two kinds of features: the numerical (continuous) ones and categorical (discrete) ones. Given xi,jsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑗x\_{i,j}italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i , italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT as the j𝑗jitalic\_j-th feature of instance 𝒙isubscript𝒙𝑖{\bm{x}}\_{i}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT, we use xi,jnum∈ℝsuperscriptsubscript𝑥𝑖𝑗numℝx\_{i,j}^{\textit{\rm num}}\in\mathbb{R}italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i , italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT start\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT num end\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∈ blackboard\_R and 𝒙i,jcatsuperscriptsubscript𝒙𝑖𝑗cat{\bm{x}}\_{i,j}^{\textit{\rm cat}}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i , italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT start\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cat end\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT to denote numerical (*e.g*., the height of a person) and categorical (*e.g*., the gender of a person) feature values of an instance, respectively. The categorical features are usually transformed in a one-hot manner, *i.e*., 𝒙i,jcat∈{0,1}Kjsuperscriptsubscript𝒙𝑖𝑗catsuperscript01subscript𝐾𝑗{\bm{x}}\_{i,j}^{\textit{\rm cat}}\in\{0,1\}^{K\_{j}}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i , italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT start\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cat end\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∈ { 0 , 1 } start\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\_K start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT end\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and the index of value 1 indicates one of the Kjsubscript𝐾𝑗K\_{j}italic\_K start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT categorical values. We assume the instance 𝒙i∈ℝdsubscript𝒙𝑖superscriptℝ𝑑{\bm{x}}\_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∈ blackboard\_R start\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\_d end\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT w.l.o.g. and will explore other encoding strategies later. Each instance is associated with a label yisubscript𝑦𝑖y\_{i}italic\_y start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT, where yi∈[C]={1,…,C}subscript𝑦𝑖delimited-[]𝐶1…𝐶y\_{i}\in[C]=\{1,\ldots,C\}italic\_y start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∈ [ italic\_C ] = { 1 , … , italic\_C } in a multi-class classification task and yi∈ℝsubscript𝑦𝑖ℝy\_{i}\in\mathbb{R}italic\_y start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∈ blackboard\_R in a regression task.

Given a tabular dataset 𝒟={(𝒙i,yi)}i=1N𝒟superscriptsubscriptsubscript𝒙𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝑖1𝑁\mathcal{D}=\{({\bm{x}}\_{i},y\_{i})\}\_{i=1}^{N}caligraphic\_D = { ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic\_y start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) } start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i = 1 end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT start\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\_N end\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, we aim to learn a model f𝑓fitalic\_f on 𝒟𝒟\mathcal{D}caligraphic\_D that maps 𝒙isubscript𝒙𝑖{\bm{x}}\_{i}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT to its label yisubscript𝑦𝑖y\_{i}italic\_y start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT. We measure the quality of f𝑓fitalic\_f by the joint likelihood on 𝒟𝒟\mathcal{D}caligraphic\_D, *i.e*., maxf⁢∏(𝒙i,yi)∈𝒟Pr⁡(yi∣f⁢(𝒙i))subscript𝑓subscriptproductsubscript𝒙𝑖subscript𝑦𝑖𝒟Prconditionalsubscript𝑦𝑖𝑓subscript𝒙𝑖\max\_{f}\prod\_{({\bm{x}}\_{i},y\_{i})\in\mathcal{D}}\Pr(y\_{i}\mid f({\bm{x}}\_{i}))roman\_max start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_f end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∏ start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic\_y start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ∈ caligraphic\_D end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman\_Pr ( italic\_y start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∣ italic\_f ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ). The objective could be reformulated in the form of negative log-likelihood of predicted labels:

The discrepancy between the predicted label y^isubscript^𝑦𝑖\hat{y}\_{i}over^ start\_ARG italic\_y end\_ARG start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the true label yisubscript𝑦𝑖y\_{i}italic\_y start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT could be measured by the loss ℓ⁢(⋅,⋅)ℓ⋅⋅\ell(\cdot,\cdot)roman\_ℓ ( ⋅ , ⋅ ), *e.g*., cross-entropy. We expect the learned model f𝑓fitalic\_f is able to extend its ability to unseen instances sampled from the same distribution as 𝒟𝒟\mathcal{D}caligraphic\_D. f𝑓fitalic\_f could be implemented with classical methods such as SVM, MLP, or tree-based approaches.

K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the most representative non-parametric tabular models for classification and regression — making predictions based on the labels of the nearest neighbors [[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib8), [38](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib38)]. In other words, the model f𝑓fitalic\_f makes predictions via f⁢(𝒙i,𝒟)𝑓subscript𝒙𝑖𝒟f({\bm{x}}\_{i},\mathcal{D})italic\_f ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT , caligraphic\_D ). Given an instance 𝒙isubscript𝒙𝑖{\bm{x}}\_{i}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT, KNN calculates the distance between 𝒙isubscript𝒙𝑖{\bm{x}}\_{i}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT and other instances in 𝒟𝒟\mathcal{D}caligraphic\_D.

The matrix 𝑴𝑴\bm{M}bold\_italic\_M is assumed to be a semi-definite one. dist𝑴2subscriptsuperscriptdist2𝑴{\rm dist}^{2}\_{\bm{M}}roman\_dist start\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold\_italic\_M end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT becomes the Euclidean distance (denoted by dist⁢(𝒙i,𝒙j)distsubscript𝒙𝑖subscript𝒙𝑗{\rm dist}({\bm{x}}\_{i},{\bm{x}}\_{j})roman\_dist ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT , bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT )) when we set the metric 𝑴𝑴\bm{M}bold\_italic\_M as the identity matrix. 𝑴𝑴\bm{M}bold\_italic\_M can be decomposed into projections 𝑴=𝑳⁢𝑳⊤𝑴𝑳superscript𝑳top\bm{M}=\bm{L}\bm{L}^{\top}bold\_italic\_M = bold\_italic\_L bold\_italic\_L start\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ⊤ end\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT with 𝑳∈ℝd×d′𝑳superscriptℝ𝑑superscript𝑑′\bm{L}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d^{\prime}}bold\_italic\_L ∈ blackboard\_R start\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\_d × italic\_d start\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT so that the Mahalanobis distance becomes the Euclidean distance in the space projected by 𝑳𝑳\bm{L}bold\_italic\_L. Most distance metric learning methods learn the metric 𝑴𝑴\bm{M}bold\_italic\_M or 𝑳𝑳\bm{L}bold\_italic\_L in two stages. Side information in the form of pairs or triplets is constructed first based on labels, guiding the similarity and comparison relationship between instances [[62](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib62), [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib14), [61](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib61), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib7)]. With the help of the learned metric, KNN then makes more accurate final predictions.

Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA). NCA is a one-stage approach that directly links the projection 𝑳𝑳\bm{L}bold\_italic\_L with the posterior probability that an instance 𝒙𝒙{\bm{x}}bold\_italic\_x is classified as the class y𝑦yitalic\_y [[19](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib19)]:

Therefore, the posterior that an instance 𝒙𝒙{\bm{x}}bold\_italic\_x belongs to the class y𝑦yitalic\_y depends on its similarity (measured by the negative squared Euclidean distance in the space projected by 𝑳𝑳\bm{L}bold\_italic\_L) between its neighbors from class y𝑦yitalic\_y in 𝒟𝒟\mathcal{D}caligraphic\_D. Instead of considering all instances in the neighborhood equally, the prediction in [Equation 3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S3.E3) mimics a soft version of KNN, where all instances in the training set are weighted (nearer neighbors have more weight) for the final decision. Similar strategies have also been explored in domains like few-shot learning [[58](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib58)].

####  4 ModernNCA

In this section, we describe the learning objective, the architecture, and the training strategy of our improved version of NCA, *i.e*., ModernNCA (abbreviated as M-NCA).

Learning Objective. We use a nonlinear transformation ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ, which maps the input 𝒙isubscript𝒙𝑖{\bm{x}}\_{i}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT into a latent space with dimensionality d′superscript𝑑′d^{\prime}italic\_d start\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. Assume the label yisubscript𝑦𝑖y\_{i}italic\_y start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT is a continuous value in a regression task and in a one-hot form in a classification task. Then we modify the [Equation 3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S3.E3) as

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | y^i=∑𝒙i∈𝒟exp⁡(−dist⁡(ϕ⁢(𝒙),ϕ⁢(𝒙i)))∑𝒙j∈𝒟,𝒙j≠𝒙iexp⁡(−dist⁡(ϕ⁢(𝒙),ϕ⁢(𝒙j)))⁢yi.subscript^𝑦𝑖subscriptsubscript𝒙𝑖𝒟distitalic-ϕ𝒙italic-ϕsubscript𝒙𝑖subscriptformulae-sequencesubscript𝒙𝑗𝒟subscript𝒙𝑗subscript𝒙𝑖distitalic-ϕ𝒙italic-ϕsubscript𝒙𝑗subscript𝑦𝑖\hat{y}\_{i}=\sum\_{{{\bm{x}}\_{i}\in\mathcal{D}}}\frac{\exp\left(-\operatorname{% dist}(\phi({\bm{x}}),\;\phi({\bm{x}}\_{i}))\right)}{\sum\_{{\bm{x}}\_{j}\in% \mathcal{D},{\bm{x}}\_{j}\neq{\bm{x}}\_{i}}\exp\left(-\operatorname{dist}(\phi({% \bm{x}}),\;\phi({\bm{x}}\_{j}))\right)}y\_{i}\;.over^ start\_ARG italic\_y end\_ARG start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ∑ start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∈ caligraphic\_D end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT divide start\_ARG roman\_exp ( - roman\_dist ( italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x ) , italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ) ) end\_ARG start\_ARG ∑ start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∈ caligraphic\_D , bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≠ bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman\_exp ( - roman\_dist ( italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x ) , italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ) ) end\_ARG italic\_y start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT . |  | (4) |

[Equation 4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S4.E4) makes predictions that similar instances (based on their distance in the embedding space mapped by ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ) will have close outputs. In the classification scenario, [Equation 4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S4.E4) generalizes [Equation 3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S3.E3) and predicts the label of the target instance with a weighted average of its neighbors in each one of the C𝐶Citalic\_C classes. y^isubscript^𝑦𝑖\hat{y}\_{i}over^ start\_ARG italic\_y end\_ARG start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT is a probability vector which can be used as {Pr⁡(y^=y∣𝒙,𝒟,ϕ)}y∈[C]subscriptPr^𝑦conditional𝑦𝒙𝒟italic-ϕ𝑦delimited-[]𝐶\{\Pr(\hat{y}=y\mid{\bm{x}},\mathcal{D},\phi)\}\_{y\in[C]}{ roman\_Pr ( over^ start\_ARG italic\_y end\_ARG = italic\_y ∣ bold\_italic\_x , caligraphic\_D , italic\_ϕ ) } start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_y ∈ [ italic\_C ] end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT in this case. In the regression scenario, the prediction of an instance is the weighted sum over the scalar labels of its neighborhood. By integrating [Equation 3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S3.E3) with [Equation 1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S3.E1), we set the loss ℓℓ\ellroman\_ℓ in [Equation 1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S3.E1) as the negative log-likelihood loss for classification, while the mean square error for regression problems. By minimizing [Equation 1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S3.E1), the embedding ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ pulls the same-class instances in the training set 𝒟𝒟\mathcal{D}caligraphic\_D close and pushes other instances away. In the test phase, neighbors of the test instance in the whole training set 𝒟𝒟\mathcal{D}caligraphic\_D are utilized to make predictions.

Architectures. We set the mapping ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ as a linear layer by default, *i.e*., ϕ⁢(𝒙i)=Linear⁢(𝒙i)italic-ϕsubscript𝒙𝑖Linearsubscript𝒙𝑖\phi({\bm{x}}\_{i})=\text{Linear}({\bm{x}}\_{i})italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) = Linear ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), containing a linear projection and a bias. We further improve the ability of 𝒙isubscript𝒙𝑖{\bm{x}}\_{i}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT with multiple nonlinear layers.

In particular, we define the one-layer nonlinear mapping as a sequential of multiple operators [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib20)], namely, the one-dimensional batch normalization [[29](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib29)], linear layer, ReLU activation, dropout [[53](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib53)], and another linear layer. In other words, the input 𝒙isubscript𝒙𝑖{\bm{x}}\_{i}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT will be transformed by

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | g⁢(𝒙i)=Linear⁢(Dropout⁢((ReLU⁢(Linear⁢(BatchNorm⁢(𝒙i)))))).𝑔subscript𝒙𝑖LinearDropoutReLULinearBatchNormsubscript𝒙𝑖g({\bm{x}}\_{i})=\text{Linear}\left(\text{Dropout}\left(\left(\text{ReLU}\left(% \text{Linear}\left(\text{BatchNorm}\left({\bm{x}}\_{i}\right)\right)\right)% \right)\right)\right)\;.italic\_g ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) = Linear ( Dropout ( ( ReLU ( Linear ( BatchNorm ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ) ) ) ) ) . |  | (5) |

Zero or more layers of blocks are applied in addition to the original linear layer to implement the final mapping. The final ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ applies an additional batch normalization to calibrate the embedding. Empirical results indicate that batch normalization outperforms other normalization strategies such as layer normalization [[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib5)] in learning a latent embedding space.

Stochastic Neighborhood Sampling. Stochastic gradient descent is usually applied to optimize deep neural networks — a batch of instances is sampled, and the batch-wise loss is calculated for back-propagation. However, pairwise distances need to be calculated during the training process, where the distances between the instance in the batch and the entire training set 𝒟𝒟\mathcal{D}caligraphic\_D are considered to estimate the loss function [Equation 4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S4.E4), introducing a high computational burden.

To accelerate the training speed of ModernNCA, we propose a Stochastic Neighborhood Sampling (SNS) strategy, where a subset 𝒟^^𝒟\hat{\mathcal{D}}over^ start\_ARG caligraphic\_D end\_ARG of the training set 𝒟𝒟\mathcal{D}caligraphic\_D is randomly sampled as the candidate instances and distances with which are calculated. In other words, 𝒟^^𝒟\hat{\mathcal{D}}over^ start\_ARG caligraphic\_D end\_ARG substitutes 𝒟𝒟\mathcal{D}caligraphic\_D in [Equation 4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S4.E4) and only the labels in 𝒟^^𝒟\hat{\mathcal{D}}over^ start\_ARG caligraphic\_D end\_ARG can be utilized to predict the label of a given instance. The model searches neighbors in the entire training set 𝒟𝒟\mathcal{D}caligraphic\_D during the inference stage.

We empirically observed that the SNS not only increases the training efficiency of ModernNCA since fewer examples are utilized for back-propagation but also SNS improves the generalization ability of the learned metric. The improvements mainly come from the fact that the mapping ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ is learned on more difficult prediction tasks during the training, so the ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ adapts to the noisy and unstable neighborhoods in the test scenario. The influence of sampling ratio and other sampling strategies are investigated in the experiments.

Remark1: Relationship with other deep tabular methods. A recent deep tabular model TabR [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib22)] also takes advantage of the nearest neighbor and predicts in a neighborhood-based manner. However, there are three main differences between our ModernNCA and TabR. First, our approach is much more concise than TabR, where the latter employs both a deep neural network and a Transformer-like architecture to search the entire training set. Our ModernNCA validates that with the prediction strategy in [Equation 4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S4.E4), only a linear layer can achieve competitive results in most cases. Second, ModernNCA is more efficient than TabR, requiring less training time and memory. This efficiency stems from both its simpler architecture and the stochastic sampling strategy. In addition, instead of using an instance-specific prediction as in TabR, ModernNCA learns an embedding space and makes predictions in a more effective manner. [Figure 1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S1.F1) demonstrates the advantages of ModernNCA in terms of performance, efficiency, and model size when compared to TabR.

Remark 2: Another way to learn the deep tabular transformation. Our ModernNCA leverages NCA to implement the objective function in [Equation 4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S4.E4), where the quality of the learned tabular embedding ϕ⁢(𝒙)italic-ϕ𝒙\phi({\bm{x}})italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x ) directly influences the classification/regression performance over 𝒙𝒙{\bm{x}}bold\_italic\_x. As mentioned in [subsection 3.2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S3.SS2), another common strategy for learning ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ involves a two-stage process: first, ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ is optimized to match the comparison relationships between mapped instances, such as triplets, and then simple classifiers like KNN and LR are applied based on ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ. Since a mini-batch ℬℬ\mathcal{B}caligraphic\_B of examples is sampled at a time during the training process, we investigate the Supervised Contrastive loss [[51](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib51), [34](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib34)], where supervision is generated within a mini-batch. The objective to learn the mapping ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ is:

P⁢(𝒙i)𝑃subscript𝒙𝑖P({\bm{x}}\_{i})italic\_P ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) is the set of instances in the mini-batch that have the same label as 𝒙isubscript𝒙𝑖{\bm{x}}\_{i}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT. τ𝜏\tauitalic\_τ is the temperature parameter used to calibrate the loss function. By minimizing [Equation 6](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S4.E6), ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ also pulls same-class instances together and pushes dissimilar ones apart. With the learned ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ, we apply KNN for classification/regression for inference. We discretize the label values in the regression scenario and denote this baseline method as Tabular Contrastive (TabCon).

####  5 Experiments

We validate the performance of ModernNCA (M-NCA) in standard tabular classification and regression tasks. Then, we analyze the properties of ModernNCA with ablation studies.

#####  5.1 Setups

Datasets. We validate our ModernNCA on 12 classification and 10 regression datasets collected from OpenML [[56](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib56)] and Kaggle. The detailed statistics of datasets are listed in [Table 5](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#A1.T5) in the appendix. Four out of the 12 classification datasets have more than two classes.

Evaluation. We mainly follow the setups in [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib20), [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib22)] to evaluate all methods. We randomly split each dataset into three partitions for training/validation/test with proportions 64%/16%/20%, respectively. For each dataset, we train a given model with 15 random seeds, and the average performance on the test set is reported. We use accuracy for classification (the higher, the better) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for regression (the lower, the better). We also follow [[16](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib16), [37](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib37)] and report the average performance rank among all methods and datasets (the lower, the better).

Comparison Methods. We compare ModernNCA with three different threads of approaches. First, we compare classical parametric tabular prediction methods, including the tree-based methods XGBoost[[12](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib12)] and CatBoost [[43](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib43)]. Then, we compare parametric deep tabular models. We follow the architecture in [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib20)] to implement MLP, and MLPPLR [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib22)] is a variant of MLP that leverages the piecewise linear encoding on numerical features [[21](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib21)]. FT-Transformer (FT-T) [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib20)] learns tokens for each attribute and then makes predictions with transformer. PTaRL is a prototype-based tabular method based on space calibration [[68](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib68)]. For neighborhood-based tabular methods, we consider K𝐾Kitalic\_KNN, metric-learning methods like LMNN [[61](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib61)] and NCA [[19](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib19)], TabR [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib22)], and our tabular contrastive baseline TabCon.111The code of our ModernNCA is available at <https://github.com/qile2000/LAMDA-TALENT>.

Implementation Details. We pre-process all datasets following [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib20)]. For all deep methods, we set the batch size as 1024. The hyper-parameters of all methods are searched based on the training and validation set via Optuna [[2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib2)] following [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib20), [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib22)] over 100 trials. The best-performed hyper-parameters are fixed during the final 15 seeds. Since the sampling rate of SNS effectively enhances the performance and reduces the training overhead, we treat it as a hyper-parameter and search within the range of [0.05, 0.6]. The metric-learning methods like LMNN are implemented based on the metric-learn library [[15](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib15)]. We use one-hot encoding for categorical features, and PLR (lite) embedding, a simplified version of PLR embedding(the combination of periodic embeddings, a linear layer, and ReLU) [[21](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib21)] proposed in [[22](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib22)], for numerical features. For a fair comparison, the same encoding strategy is also applied in MLPPLR and TabR.

Table 1: The average accuracy (the higher, the better) of all methods on 12 classification datasets. The best results on each dataset are in bold, and the second-best ones are underlined. We also report the average rank of different methods among all datasets (the lower, the better).

#####  5.2 Main Results

The comparison results between ModernNCA and other methods for classification and regression tasks are reported in [Table 1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S5.T1) and [Table 2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S5.T2), respectively, where ModernNCA achieves the best average rank in both cases.

For classification results in [Table 1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S5.T1), ModernNCA achieves better results than tree-based methods like XGBoost in most cases, which indicates that utilizing deep neural network ModernNCA has a stronger ability to make nonlinear predictions. It is clearly observed that although classical metric learning methods such as LMNN and NCA can improve KNN in some cases, they are difficult to achieve competitive performance as tree-based and deep methods. When compared with deep tabular methods like FT-T and MLPPLR, ModernNCA still keeps its superiority. The most related comparison method is TabR, which extracts features of all neighbors in the training set and makes predictions with a variant of Transformer. Our ModernNCA outperforms TabR with simpler architecture and shorter training time. The results indicate that ModernNCA acts as an effective tabular deep baseline. Our TabCon baseline also demonstrates the effectiveness of its learned mapping, outperforming classical metric learning methods in all cases. TabCon is competitive with FT-T and even surpasses XGBoost in some cases, such as “HE” and “PH”. The superiority of ModernNCA over TabCon may result from the direct linkage between the learned mapping and prediction performance in ModernNCA. Similar phenomena exist in regression cases in [Table 2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S5.T2). ModernNCA is the only deep model that consistently outperforms tree-based methods on regression datasets overall. Classical metric-learning methods cannot be applied to regression directly. Our ModernNCA shows its superiority over two competitive methods MLPPLR and TabR. [Figure 1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S1.F1) indicates the comparison between representative classification and regression methods w.r.t. the performance, training time, and model size over all datasets. Although some models, such as TabR, obtain strong performance, they require much longer training time. Our ModernNCA makes a good balance among various model evaluation criteria.

The scientific notation beside the dataset name indicates the scale of the results, *e.g*., ×10absent10\times 10× 10 means the final value of all results should be multiple by 10101010. We also report the average rank among all datasets (the lower, the better).

#####  5.3 Ablation Studies

We analyze different properties of the proposed ModernNCA based on three datasets, with CA/MIA for regression and AD/PH for classification.

Linear vs. Deep Architectures. We first investigate the design of architectures ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ in ModernNCA, where we add one or more layers of blocks g⁢(⋅)𝑔⋅g(\cdot)italic\_g ( ⋅ ) based on a linear projection. The number of layers is set as a hyper-parameter and could be determined based on the validation set. We consider three choices. First, we set ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ as the linear projection, where the dimensionality of the projected space is the hyper-parameter. We also replace batch normalization in the block with layer normalization. Finally, we equip ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ with another residual link from the block’s input to its output.

The results are listed in [Table 3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S5.T3), and we also include the results of TabR/NCA for reference. Although NCA uses a linear projection, we find the linear version of ModernNCA (the fourth column) achieves much better performance on two classification datasets. For example, on AD, the linear version of ModernNCA outperforms NCA by around 4%. The comparison indicates that the objective and training strategy of ModernNCA is essential. When compared with the last column where ModernNCA utilizes the deep neural network, we find the usage of nonlinear deep architecture is necessary on datasets such as MIA. The linear version can achieve competitive or even better results since the projected dimension is searched in a smaller hyper-parameter space, and for ModernNCA the number of additional layers is searched based on the validation set from zero to more layers.

The variant of the fifth column utilizes another normalization strategy, layer normalization, in the blocks instead of batch normalization in ModernNCA. We empirically find that batch normalization performs better on average, especially in classification tasks. When comparing residual and MLP blocks in the last two columns, we find using multiple nonlinear layers directly performs a bit better, so we choose the MLP implementation in [Equation 5](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S4.E5) for ModernNCA.

The Influence of Distance Functions. The predicted label of a target instance 𝒙isubscript𝒙𝑖{\bm{x}}\_{i}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT is determined by the label of its neighbors in the learned embedding space projected by ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ. The distance function is the key to determining the pairwise relationship between instances in the embedding space and influences the weights in [Equation 4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S4.E4). In ModernNCA, we choose Euclidean distance distEUC⁢(ϕ⁢(𝒙i),ϕ⁢(𝒙j))=(ϕ⁢(𝒙i)−ϕ⁢(𝒙j))⊤⁢(ϕ⁢(𝒙i)−ϕ⁢(𝒙j))=‖ϕ⁢(𝒙i)−ϕ⁢(𝒙j)‖2subscriptdistEUCitalic-ϕsubscript𝒙𝑖italic-ϕsubscript𝒙𝑗superscriptitalic-ϕsubscript𝒙𝑖italic-ϕsubscript𝒙𝑗topitalic-ϕsubscript𝒙𝑖italic-ϕsubscript𝒙𝑗subscriptnormitalic-ϕsubscript𝒙𝑖italic-ϕsubscript𝒙𝑗2{\rm dist}\_{\rm EUC}(\phi({\bm{x}}\_{i}),\phi({\bm{x}}\_{j}))=\sqrt{(\phi({\bm{x% }}\_{i})-\phi({\bm{x}}\_{j}))^{\top}(\phi({\bm{x}}\_{i})-\phi({\bm{x}}\_{j}))}=\|% \phi({\bm{x}}\_{i})-\phi({\bm{x}}\_{j})\|\_{2}roman\_dist start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman\_EUC end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) , italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ) = square-root start\_ARG ( italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) - italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ) start\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ⊤ end\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) - italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ) end\_ARG = ∥ italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) - italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ∥ start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT.

The Influence of Sampling Ratios. Due to the huge computational cost of calculating distance in the learned embedding space, our ModernNCA utilizes a Stochastic Neighborhood Sampling (SNS) strategy, where only a proportion of training set data are randomly sampled for each mini-batch. The whole training set is utilized in the test phase. Due to the usage of a subset of sampling data, the training time cost is reduced a lot. We vary the proportion and evaluate the corresponding test performance of the model in [Figure 2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S5.F2). We observe from [Figure 2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S5.F2) that 30%-50% ratios of the training set help more for ModernNCA than using the full training set. SNS not only improves the training efficiency but also the model’s generalization ability. The plots demonstrate that the ratio of sampled training data matters, which is a hyper-parameter tuned for ModernNCA.

The Influence of Sampling Strategy. As mentioned before, SNS randomly samples a subset of training data for each mini-batch when calculating the loss of [Equation 4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S4.E4). We also investigate whether we could further improve the classification/regression ability of the model when we incorporate richer information during the sampling process, *e.g*., the label of the instances.

We consider another two sampling strategies in addition to the fully random one we used before. First is class-wise random sampling, which means that given a proportion, we sample from each class in the training set and combine them together. This strategy takes advantage of the training label information and keeps the instances from all classes that will exist in the sampled subset. Besides, we also consider the sampling strategy based on the pairwise distances between instances. Since the neighbors of an instance may contribute more (with larger weights) in [Equation 4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S4.E4), so given a mini-batch, we first calculate the Euclidean distance between instances in the batch and all the training set with the embedding function ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ in the current epoch. Then we sample the training set based on the reciprocal of the pairwise distance value. In detail, given an instance 𝒙isubscript𝒙𝑖{\bm{x}}\_{i}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT, we provide instance-specific neighborhood candidates and 𝒙jsubscript𝒙𝑗{\bm{x}}\_{j}bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT in the training set is sampled based on the probability ∼1/(dist⁢(ϕ⁢(𝒙i),ϕ⁢(𝒙j)))τsimilar-toabsent1superscriptdistitalic-ϕsubscript𝒙𝑖italic-ϕsubscript𝒙𝑗𝜏\sim 1/({\rm dist}(\phi({\bm{x}}\_{i}),\phi({\bm{x}}\_{j})))^{\tau}∼ 1 / ( roman\_dist ( italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_i end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) , italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x start\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\_j end\_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ) ) start\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic\_τ end\_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. τ𝜏\tauitalic\_τ is a non-negative hyper-parameter to calibrate the distribution. The distance calculation requires forward passes of the model ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ over all the training instances, and the instance-specific neighborhood makes the loss related to a wide range of the training data. Therefore, the distance-based sampling strategy has a low training speed and high computational burden.

![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1/x5.png)Figure 3: The influence of different sampling strategies, namely, the random strategy, the label-based strategy, and the distance-based strategy.
The comparison results between different sampling strategies on two classification datasets are listed in [Figure 3](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S5.F3). We find the label-based sampling strategy cannot provide further improvements. Although the distance-based strategy helps in certain cases, the improvements are limited. Taking a holistic consideration of the performance and efficiency, we choose to use the vanilla random sampling in ModernNCA.

Learning with Few-Shot Data. We investigate the change in performance when the number of training examples is limited. The results are shown in [Figure 4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S5.F4). Given a dataset, we synthesize the few-shot learning scenario by randomly sampling a subset of the training data with the radio changes from {0.05%,0.1%,0.2%,0.5%,1%}percent0.05percent0.1percent0.2percent0.5percent1\{0.05\%,0.1\%,0.2\%,0.5\%,1\%\}{ 0.05 % , 0.1 % , 0.2 % , 0.5 % , 1 % }. Due to the small-size of the training set, we learn all methods with the default hyper-parameters. The results are repeated 10 times and the average of them are reported. Based on the few-shot performance shown in [Figure 4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S5.F4), we find our ModernNCA is competitive when compared with other tabular prediction methods.

####  6 Conclusion

Making predictions by leveraging relationships within a learned embedding space is a classical metric learning notion in machine learning. While traditional metric learning methods often underperform compared to tree-based approaches on tabular datasets, our study revisits and enhances one of the most representative methods, NCA. The improved ModernNCA establishes itself as a strong baseline for deep tabular prediction tasks, often outperforming other methods in terms of classification and regression capabilities, while also reducing model size and training time. We believe our research will encourage further investigation into classical methods within the field of tabular data. By making minor yet effective modifications to their core concepts, these methods can be revitalized, offering significant improvements and novel solutions.

####  Appendix A Datasets

In this section, we present the preprocessing steps applied to the dataset before training, along with a detailed description of the dataset we used.

#####  A.1 Data Pre-processing

We follow [[20](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib20)] and pre-process datasets for all methods. For example, we use standardization, involving mean subtraction and scaling, to normalize each numerical dataset. We also apply one-hot encoding on all categorical features.

#####  A.2 Dataset Information

The datasets come from different domains, including [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/) [[56](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib56)] and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). These datasets are commonly used in the tabular prediction fields [[23](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib23), [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib20)]. The descriptions are shown in [Table 5](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#A1.T5). To reduce randomness, we used datasets with sample sizes greater than 1000.

Table 5: Descriptions of all datasets. There are 8 binary classification datasets, 4 multi-class classification datasets, and 10 regression datasets.

We randomly sample 20% instances to construct the test set. The remaining 80% instances are used for splitting. In the training set, we randomly hold out 20% of instances as the validation set. The validation set is used for tuning hyper-parameters and carrying out early stopping. We selected the model that performed best on the validation set with tuned hyper-parameters for evaluation.

#####  A.3 Hardware

The majority of experiments were conducted on the Tesla V100 GPU, including those related to time and memory overhead calculation.

#####  A.4 Implementations of TabCon

TabCon is trained using Supervised Contrastive loss in a two-stage process. In the training stage, a mapping ϕitalic-ϕ\phiitalic\_ϕ, defined the same as ModernNCA for simplicity, is trained to project the original features into a latent space as described in [Equation 7](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S4.E7). Before calculating the Supervised Contrastive loss, each mapping ϕ⁢(𝒙)italic-ϕ𝒙\phi({\bm{x}})italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x ) is normalized to unit length. In the validation stage, a simple predictor (*e.g*., KNN and LR) is further trained based on the mappings learned in the training stage. Early stopping is applied during the validation stage based on the performance of the simple predictor. We use KNN with Euclidean distance as the default predictor.

Since Supervised Contrastive loss was originally proposed for classification, we discretize the labels for regression tasks before calculating the loss. Specifically, the samples are divided into different bins according to their values, and we use quantiles as the boundaries of the bins to ensure that each bin contains a similar number of samples. The number of bins is set as a hyper-parameter.

####  Appendix B Additional Experiments

#####  B.1 Additional Ablation Studies

The Influence of PLR Embedding. The results of ModernNCA in [Table 1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S5.T1) and [Table 2](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S5.T2) leverage the PLR embedding for numerical features [[21](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib21)] (where all categorical features are processed in the one-hot form). We compare ModernNCA as well as MLP with or without PLR in [Table 6](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#A2.T6).

The results demonstrate that our ModernNCA can also utilize the advantages of PLR to achieve further improvements. However, different from MLP, the vanilla variant of ModernNCA without PLR is still competitive. For example, in regression dataset CA, ModernNCA without PLR can outperform MLP as well as MLPPLR. The results validate that the ability of ModernNCA comes from its objective, architecture, and training strategy, not mainly from the PLR encoding strategy.

Table 6: Results of MLP and our ModernNCA with or without the PLR encoding on numerical attributes.

Other Implementations of TabCon. As mentioned in [subsection A.4](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#A1.SS4), there are different choices for the predictors constructed based on the learned embeddings ϕ⁢(𝒙)italic-ϕ𝒙\phi({\bm{x}})italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x ) using Supervised Contrastive loss. We consider two variants here: the first is KNN, and the second is Logistic Regression for classification and Linear Regression for regression. We denote these two prediction methods as TabCon and TabCon (LR), respectively. We compare the results of these two variants in [Table 7](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#A2.T7). The results show that while different methods perform variably across datasets, their overall performance is comparable. Given that KNN has a lower training overhead, we use it as the default configuration.

Table 7: Results of TabCon variants with different ways to make predictions. The default choice of TabCon utilizes KNN based on the learned embeddings.

| TabCon (LR) | .4724 | 87.09 | .9017 | 86.69 |

Visualization Results. To better analyze the properties of ModernNCA, we visualize the learned embeddings ϕ⁢(𝒙)italic-ϕ𝒙\phi({\bm{x}})italic\_ϕ ( bold\_italic\_x ) of ModernNCA, TabCon, and TabR using TSNE [[55](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#bib.bib55)]. As shown in [Figure 5](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#A2.F5), all deep tabular methods transform the embedding spaces to be more helpful for classification or regression compared to the raw features. The embedding space learned by TabCon clusters samples of the same class together and separates samples of different classes, often clustering same-class instances into a single cluster. However, it still struggles with some hard-to-distinguish samples. TabR and ModernNCA, on the other hand, divide samples of the same class into multiple clusters, ensuring that similar samples are positioned closer to each other. This strategy aligns with the prediction mechanism of KNN, where good performance is achieved by clustering instances with similar neighbors together rather than into a single cluster. The embedding space learned by ModernNCA is more discriminative than that learned by TabR. The main reason is that TabR leverages a transformer-like architecture to modify the embedding for each instance before making predictions, making the learned embedding space less discriminative compared to ModernNCA.

#####  B.2 Run-time and Memory Usage Estimation

We make a run-time and memory usage comparison in [Figure 1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#S1.F1). Here are the steps that we take to perform the estimation. First, we tuned all models on the validation set for 100 iterations, saving the optimal parameters ever found. Next, we ran the models for 15 iterations with the tuned parameters and saved the best checkpoint on the validation set. The run-time for the models was estimated using the average time taken by the tuned model to run one seed in the training and validation stage. The model size was estimated using the size of the saved checkpoint. Here we present the average results of run-time and memory usage estimation across our benchmark datasets in [Table 8](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.03257v1#A2.T8).

Table 8: Training time and memory usage estimation for different tuned models on the benchmark datasets. The average rank represents the mean performance ranking of these models based on the performance metrics (RMSE for regression and accuracy for classification).

| Training Time (s) | 87.5 | 53.16 | 30.36 | 38.94 | 111.91 | 173.34 | 4.53 | 20.48 |
